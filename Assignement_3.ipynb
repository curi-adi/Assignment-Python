On the other hand, a function call is the act of invoking or executing a function by using its name followed by parentheses. The function call causes the code inside the function to run and perform its designated operations."

It exists throughout the entire program and any variables defined outside of functions belong to this global scope. On the other hand, local scopes are created whenever a function is called. Each function call creates a new local scope, which is independent and separate from other local scopes. Variables defined within a function belong to its local scope and are not accessible outside of it."

After the function call returns, the program continues execution from where the function was called, and any variables created within the local scope become inaccessible."

It is specified using the \"return\" statement followed by the value or expression that should be returned. The return value allows the function to provide the result of its computation or any other relevant information to the caller. Yes, it is possible to have a return value in an expression. For example, you can directly use the return value of a function within another expression or assign it to a variable."

None is a special object in Python that represents the absence of a value. When a function executes without encountering a return statement, it implicitly returns None."

By doing so, you inform Python that the variable being used is a global variable, rather than creating a new local variable with the same name. This allows you to access and modify the global variable from within the function."

        "A: To save a program from crashing if it encounters an error, you can use error handling techniques such as exception handling. Placing the potentially problematic code inside a try block allows you to catch and handle any exceptions that occur. By using the try-except statement, you can specify the actions to be taken if an exception is raised, preventing the program from abruptly terminating. Additionally, logging errors and providing informative error messages can help in identifying and resolving issues."

        "The except clause is used to define the actions or code that should be executed when a specific exception occurs. It specifies the type of exception to catch, allowing you to handle the exception gracefully. By providing one or more except clauses, you can define different exception handlers for different types of exceptions. If no matching exception occurs, the except block is skipped, and the program continues execution after the try-except statement."
